Manage IPs Feature for Horizon (OpenStack Dashboard)
====================================================

This feature adds an option to the instance action dropdown which lets you manage its IPs.

The "Manage IPs" action is shown when the instance is in an active state.

Through this action, you can add, update and remove the IPs of the instance.

This patch requires the `novaguestclient` package.
